## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Data Cleaning ‚úÖ

- [x] Load listings.csv into pandas DataFrame
- [x] Drop irrelevant columns
- [x] Convert price to numeric format
- [x] Handle missing values
- [x] Encode categorical variables
- [x] Create new features
- [x] Second pass: Complete missing value elimination
- [x] Final optimization pass for modeling performance

**Key Data Cleaning Steps Completed:**

**First Pass:**

1. **Import additional libraries** - Added numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn's LabelEncoder
2. **Drop irrelevant columns** - Removed URLs, IDs, descriptions, and other non-predictive features (reduced from 79 to ~60 columns)
3. **Convert price to numeric** - Cleaned price column from string format (e.g., "$150.00") to float values
4. **Handle missing values** - Filled missing values in key columns (bedrooms, bathrooms, beds, review_scores_rating) with median values
5. **Encode categorical variables** - Converted categorical features (room_type, neighbourhood_group_cleansed, property_type) to numeric using label encoding
6. **Create new features** - Added three new predictive features:
   - `price_per_accommodate`: Price divided by number of guests accommodated
   - `has_reviews`: Binary indicator if listing has any reviews
   - `review_score_ratio`: Normalized review score (0-1 scale)
7. **Final data check** - Verified cleaned dataset and saved to `cleaned_listings.csv`

**Second Pass - Complete Missing Value Elimination:** 8. **Drop low-value columns** - Removed additional columns with high missing values or low predictive power:

- `neighbourhood` (redundant with neighbourhood_group_cleansed)
- `first_review`, `last_review` (time-series complexity)
- `host_location`, `host_since` (high missing values, low predictive value)

9. **Handle review-related missing values** - Filled all review score columns with 0 (indicating no reviews)
10. **Handle host-related missing values** - Filled host attributes with appropriate defaults:
    - `host_is_superhost`: filled with mode
    - `has_availability`: converted to binary and filled with mode
    - Host response columns: filled with median or 'unknown'
11. **Handle remaining missing values** - Systematic approach:
    - Numerical columns: filled with median values
    - Categorical columns: filled with mode or appropriate defaults
12. **Encode remaining categorical variables** - Automatically detected and encoded any remaining categorical columns
13. **Final verification** - Ensured ALL columns have exactly 21,833 non-null values (no missing data)
14. **Save final dataset** - Exported to `cleaned_listings_final.csv`

**Final Optimization Pass - Modeling Performance Enhancement:** 15. **Log transformation of target variable** - Created `log_price = np.log(price + 1)` to address severe skewness: - Original price skewness: ~23.19 (heavily skewed) - Log-transformed skewness: significantly reduced for better model performance - Conversion formula: `np.exp(log_price_prediction) - 1` to get actual price 16. **Redundant feature removal** - Systematically dropped highly correlated features to reduce multicollinearity: - Review redundancy: Dropped `review_score_ratio`, kept `review_scores_rating` - Host redundancy: Dropped `host_total_listings_count`, kept `host_listings_count` - Property redundancy: Dropped `property_type`, kept `room_type` - Review count redundancy: Dropped `number_of_reviews_ltm`, `number_of_reviews_ly`, `reviews_per_month` - Availability redundancy: Dropped `availability_eoy`, kept `availability_365` - Nights redundancy: Dropped all `_minimum`, `_maximum`, `_avg_ntm` variants - Host listings redundancy: Dropped room-type-specific counts, kept main count - Occupancy redundancy: Dropped `estimated_occupancy_l365d` 17. **Scaling preparation** - Identified numerical features requiring standardization for linear models: - Tree-based models (Random Forest, XGBoost): No scaling needed - Linear models (Ridge, Lasso, KNN): StandardScaler required for numerical features 18. **Final dataset optimization** - Exported model-ready dataset as `model_ready_listings.csv`: - Optimized feature set with reduced multicollinearity - Log-transformed target variable for better model performance - All preprocessing complete and ready for feature selection

### Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) ‚úÖ

- [x] Basic statistical analysis
- [x] Price distribution visualization
- [x] Feature correlation analysis
- [x] Outlier detection

**Key EDA Analysis Completed:**

**2.1 Target Distribution Analysis:**

- **Price statistics and outlier detection** using IQR method with bounds calculation
- **Skewness analysis** with automated recommendations for log transformation
- **Comprehensive visualizations**: histogram, box plot, log-transformed distribution, and Q-Q plot
- **Distribution assessment** to determine if price transformation is needed for modeling

**2.2 Categorical Feature Analysis:**

- **Price analysis by room type and borough** with bar charts showing mean prices and sample counts
- **Box plot distributions** comparing price ranges across different categories
- **Summary statistics** for each categorical level (mean, median, count)

**2.3 Numerical Feature Analysis:**

- **Scatter plots with trend lines** for 8 key numerical features vs price
- **Correlation coefficients** calculated and displayed for each feature relationship
- **Feature relationship assessment** for accommodates, bedrooms, bathrooms, beds, reviews, etc.
- **Visual identification** of linear and non-linear relationships

**2.4 Correlation Heatmap:**

- **Comprehensive correlation matrix** of all numerical features with masked upper triangle
- **High correlation pairs identification** (|r| > 0.7) to detect multicollinearity
- **Top features correlated with price** ranking for feature importance insights
- **Visual correlation patterns** using color-coded heatmap

**2.5 Data Quality & Leakage Check:**

- **Encoding quality verification** for binary (0/1) and categorical variables
- **Data leakage detection** for features like estimated_revenue_l365d that could "cheat"
- **Final missing values confirmation** ensuring 21,833 non-null values across all columns
- **Sanity checks** for all data transformations and encodings

**2.6 EDA Summary & Recommendations:**
